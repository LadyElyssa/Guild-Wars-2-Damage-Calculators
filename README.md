These are Libre Office Calc Spreadsheets (.ods) that provide some basic calculations to estimate the potential DPS including suggestions for **Food** and **Consumables** based purely on the stats provided.

## Simple pDPS / cDPS Calcs

The Simple Calcs are usable as is.


## Combat Calcs pDPS - In Beta

These are still undergoing development, so there may still be some housekeeping to be done. It uses imported data from the API in order to help keep things up to date with each balance patch. This is currently done manually by exporting the API JSON Data to XML files and then converting them to CSV so they can be imported in to the spreadsheet. I have included the .CSV files here for easy access up to build version 115267.

I had hoped to read / import the data more directly from XML files but have had not joy in making use of the X-PATH commands with FILTERXML, so if anyone out there knows of a simple and easy way to do this without the need for Macros or making any changes to the default settings for Libre Office Calc then I'd like to hear from you as am currently having to filter the CSV Data which is undoubtedly less efficient.
